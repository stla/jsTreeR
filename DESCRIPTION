Description: Creates interactive trees that can be included in 'Shiny' apps and R markdown documents. A tree allows to represent hierarchical data (e.g. the contents of a directory). Similar to the 'shinyTree' package but offers more features and options, such as the grid extension, restricting the drag-and-drop behavior, and settings for the search functionality. It is possible to attach some data to the nodes of a tree and then to get these data in 'Shiny' when a node is selected.
